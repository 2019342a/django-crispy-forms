CHANGELOG
=========

For 0.6.0

 * Removed a <hr /> from the layout module
 * Changed templatetags/uni_form.py to templatetags/uni_form_tags.py. Yes, this breaks backwards compatibility but fixes a namespace problems in Django with naming a templatetag library after the parent application.
 * Changed form_action attribute to accept not just named URLs but also any old URL.
