CHANGELOG
=========

For 0.8.0

 * Improved internal documentation
 * form methods generated by FormHelper are in lowercase (http://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form/issues#issue/20)
 * uni_form.helpers.formHelper or None object must be passed into uni_form tag or a TypeError is thrown.
 * Thanks to Nagy Viktor added form_tag attribute to FormHelper. Now you can use the uni_form tag without the leading and training form tags.

For 0.7.0

 * Removed a <hr /> from the layout module.
 * Changed templatetags/uni_form.py to templatetags/uni_form_tags.py. Yes, this breaks backwards compatibility but fixes a namespace problems in Django with naming a templatetag library after the parent application.
 * Changed form_action attribute to accept not just named URLs but also any old URL.
 * Added in uni_form_setup tag.
 * Added tests
 * Added several new contributors including Dragan Babic
 * Added Danish language translation
